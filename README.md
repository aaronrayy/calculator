# calculator
INTRO:
    simple calculator project with gui using python and tkinter

LIBRARIES NEEDED:
    tkinter
    To install tkinter:
        'pip install tk'

ASSUMPTIONS:
    this is a basic calculator. it only supports one operation in a command (for example, the expression '44 x 12 / 3' is not valid. '44 x 3' is). after the result is displayed, the user must clear (use the 'C' button) the calculator to clear the current string variable representing the output.
